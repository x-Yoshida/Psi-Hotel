Defining a lower number of nights of stay for a room will NOT affect the pricing, which will still be based on the total number of nights of stay of the main reservation. If you wish to adjust the pricing when a room needs to change the dates of stay, then you should remove this room from the main reservation and manually create a new booking for this room, for the same customer, by selecting the proper check-in and check-out dates.
